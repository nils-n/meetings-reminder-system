This python-based web app is designed to keep track of open meetings, send reminder meetings to participants, and reminder to oneself if the meeting itself, or one of the participants, has not confirmed his or her assistance.

## Testing 

### Testing Procedure 
The website was tested extensively for several apsects , and the results were documented in [---TO DO ---TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) 

- Functionality
- User Stories
- Usability and Accessibility 
- Compatibility and Responsiveness 

Also, this website was developed using a `test-driven development` (TDD) approach using the `pytest` framework for python. Results of of the unit tests are documented in same document above. The reasons for TDD is to 
- ... ensure core functionality
- ... better code re-usability 
- ... better code readibility by enforcing smaller functions.

(clean code principles).

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **March 14, 2023**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
